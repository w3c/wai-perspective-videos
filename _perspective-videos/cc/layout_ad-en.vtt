Poor layout can be very frustrating.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.360
And the same applies to the Web.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.300
Good design involves good layout

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.820
and that means a better user experience.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.560
This includes clear headings, navigation bars, and consistent styling.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.000
Any web user will get frustrated with bad layout and design.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.980
Complex layouts also make finding information difficult

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.840
or impossible for people with visual disabilities.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.540
And they are confusing for people with cognitive and learning disabilities

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.440
who need clarity and consistency of the presentation.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.780
Bad design also impacts anyone who isn't particularly confident around computers.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.020
Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all.
