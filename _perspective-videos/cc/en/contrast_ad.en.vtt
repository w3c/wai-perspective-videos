There's something about great design

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.920
that allows it to go practically unnoticed.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.740
But it doesn't take much to make things confusing and frustrating

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.840
Choosing colors with poor contrast makes navigating, reading and interacting a real pain

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.740
Good design means sufficient contrast between foreground background and colors.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.540
That's not just text and images but links, icons, and buttons.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.700
If it's important enough to be seen, then it needs to be clear.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.680
And this is essential for people with low contrast sensitivity.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.000
Which becomes more common as we age.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.140
With good colors, websites and applications can be easier to use in more situations

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.920
can be easier to use in more situations.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.460
Like in different lighting conditions.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.800
Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all.
