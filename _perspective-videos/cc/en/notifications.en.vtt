00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.600
All the right gears can be put in motion.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.020
The hands can be at the exact place they need to be.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.140
But if you don't get the response that you're expecting,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.780
you'll end up wondering if there's some sort of problem.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.380
It's the same on the Web.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.900
Without clear notifications and feedback,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.220
people are quickly disorientated and confused.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.620
Especially error messages which are often complex and confusing.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.880
Yet making the understandable is usually quite simple.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.380
Making websites and apps predictable and understandable

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.960
makes them accessible to people with cognitive and learning disabilities,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.760
and more usable for everyone.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.020
Especially for people with lower computer skills.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.840
Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all.
