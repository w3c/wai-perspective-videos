Customization isn't always just a question of preference though.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.060
Sometimes, it's a necessity.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.740
Being able to adjust the text is crucial with low vision and dyslexia.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.620
Properly coded websites and applications allow the text to be customized.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.080
For example, to change its size, spacing, font, and colors

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.620
without loss of functions or clarity.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.620
