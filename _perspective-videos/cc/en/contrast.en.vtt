There's something about great design

00:00:07.581 --> 00:00:10.740
that allows it to go practically unnoticed.

00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:15.000
But it doesn't take much to make things confusing and frustrating.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.900
Choosing colors with poor contrast makes navigating, reading, and interacting a real pain.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.880
Good design means sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.820
That's not just text and images but links, icons, and buttons.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.720
If it's important enough to be seen, then it needs to be clear.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.800
And this is essential for people with low contrast sensitivity.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.640
Which becomes more common as we age.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.720
With good colors, websites and applications

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.980
can be easier to use in more situations.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.620
Like in different lighting conditions.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.880
Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all.
