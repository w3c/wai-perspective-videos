00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.300
Not being able to use your computer

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.260
because you mouse doesn't work, is frustrating.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.720
Many people use only the keyboard to navigate websites.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.140
Either through preference or circumstance.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.340
Whether it's temporarily limited mobility,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.580
a permanent physical disability,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.580
or simply a broken mouse,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.580
the result is the same:

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.520
Websites and apps need to be operable by keyboard.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.800
Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all.
