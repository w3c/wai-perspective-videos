Trying to hit a small target requires lots of effort.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.980
Many websites and applications try to thread the needle.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.580
But on the Web, we can make areas for clicking and tapping larger and easier to use.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.220
Which is handy on mobile devices

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.680
especially when we might be moving around at the time.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.460
Which is critical for people with reduced dexterity.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.620
Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all.
