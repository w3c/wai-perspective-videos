00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.060
Instead of saying:

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.420
"To postulate a conceit more irksome

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.760
than being addressed in sesquipedalian syntax is adamantine",

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.900
it is better to say:

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.760
"Being spoken to in unnecessarily long

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.880
and complicated language is a pain".

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.280
Yet many websites lack structuring

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.180
using headings, lists and separation .

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.920
Or they use overly complex language, jargon,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.300
and unexplained acronyms.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.840
It makes them difficult and unappealing to use for many people,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.840
including non-native speakers,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.880
and makes them unusable for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.880
Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all.
