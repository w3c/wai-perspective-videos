Imagine if you could only communicate with your family by writing.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.460
Sometimes it's just easier to speak.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.620
One of the advances of technology is voice recognition.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.060
Whether it's searching the web:

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Tablet user> "Nineteenth century architecture."

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.440
Dictating emails.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.560
Or controlling your navigation app.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.300
Many people with physical disabilities 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.180
rely on voice recognition to use the computer.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.280
<v Man in wheelchair> "Place order."

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.860
But for that to happen websites and apps need to be properly coded.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Man in wheelchair> "Cancel?"

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.960
Voice recognition can help lots of other people

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.100
 with temporary limitations too, like an injured arm.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Woman> "Place order."

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.040
It can also prevent injuries becoming worse,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.000
like RSI: Repetitive Stress Injury.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.500
Or for people simple preferring voice.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.500
<v Man in wheelchair> "Place Order."

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.020
Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all.
