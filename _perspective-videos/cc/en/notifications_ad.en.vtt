00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.380
All the right gears can be put in motion.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.580
The hands can be at the exact place they need to be.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.580
But if you don't get the response that you're expecting,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.260
you'll end up wondering if there's some sort of problem.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.460
It's the same on the Web.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.060
Without clear notifications and feedback,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.040
people are quickly disorientated and confused.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.260
Especially error messages which are often complex and confusing.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.100
Yet making them understandable is usually quite simple.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.600
Making websites and apps predictable and understandable

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.660
makes them accessible for people with cognitive and learning disabilities,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.840
and more usable for everyone.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.760
Especially people with lower computer skills.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.200
Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all.
