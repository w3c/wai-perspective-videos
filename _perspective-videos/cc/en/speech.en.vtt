<v Computer> "Some people can't see the text on this screen."

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.480
<v Computer> "Fortunately, computers can convert text to speech."

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.580
It's technology that many people who are blind have been relying on for years.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.180
But it's also important for many people with dyslexia.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.020
And very useful for people who have difficulty reading text.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.000
As well as some people who just like to multi-task.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.020
But for this to work,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.040
websites and apps have to be properly coded.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.120
Which has the added benefit of helping search engines index websites' contents better.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.180
Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all.
