Video isn't just about pictures,

00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:12.040
it's also about sound.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.280
Without the audio, you would have to guess what this film is about.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.730
Frustrating isn't it?

00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:26.880
Not knowing what's going on.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.840
That's the situation for everyone who can't hear.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.520
Captions make videos accessible.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.720
Which is also handy for people who want to watch video in loud environments.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.040
Or where you need to be very, very quiet.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.900
Web accessibility: essential for some, useful for all.
