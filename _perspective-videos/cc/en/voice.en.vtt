Imagine if you could only communicate with your family by writing.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.480
Sometimes it's just easier to speak.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.360
One of the advances of technology is voice recognition.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.000
Whether it's searching the Web:

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.000
<v Tablet user> "Nineteenth Century Architecture."

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.200
Dictating emails:

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.180
<v Older man> "Send email to Jack Harding."

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.120
Or controlling your navigation app.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.740
Many people with physical disabilities 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.940
rely on voice recognition to use the computer.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Man in wheelchair> "Place order."

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.120
But for that to happen websites and apps need to be properly coded.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.160
<v Man in wheelchair> "Go? Cancel?"

00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:44.920
Voice recognition could help lots of other people

00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:47.740
with temporary limitations too, like an injured arm.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.740
<v Woman> "Place order."

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.240
It can also prevent injuries becoming worse,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.400
like RSI: Repetitive Stress Injury.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.020
Or for people simply preferring voice.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.020
Web accessibility: 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.160
<v Man in wheelchair> "Place Order."

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.120
Essential for some, useful for all.
