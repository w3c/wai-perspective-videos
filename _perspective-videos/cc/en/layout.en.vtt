Poor layout can be very frustrating.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.960
And the same applies to the Web.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.340
Good design involves good layout

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.780
and that means a better user experience.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.920
This includes clear headings, navigation bars, and consistent styling.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.100
Any web user will get frustrated with bad layout and design.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.160
Complex layouts also make finding information difficult

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.620
or impossible for people with visual disabilities.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.660
And they are confusing for people with cognitive and learning disabilities

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.980
who need clarity and consistency of the presentation.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.340
Bad design also impacts anyone who isn't particularly confident around computers.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.940
Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all.
