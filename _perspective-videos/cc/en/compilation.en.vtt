00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.120
Video isn't just about pictures,

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:07.920
it's also about sound.

00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:12.920
Without the audio you would have to guess what this film is about.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.880
Frustrating, isn't it?

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.280
Not knowing what's going on.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.000
That's the situation for everyone who can't hear.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.240
Captions make videos accessible.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.160
Which is also handy for people who want to watch video in loud environments.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.030
Or where you need to be very, very quiet.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.580
There's something about great design

00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:48.740
that allows it to go practically unnoticed.

00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:53.000
But it doesn't take much to make things confusing and frustrating.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.900
Choosing colors with poor contrast makes navigating, reading, and interacting a real pain.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.880
Good design means sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.820
That's not just text and images but links, icons, and buttons.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.720
If it's important enough to be seen, then it needs to be clear.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.800
And this is essential for people with low contrast sensitivity.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.640
Which becomes more common as we age.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.720
With good colors, websites and applications

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.980
can be easier to use in more situations.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.620
Like in different lighting conditions.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.040
Imagine if you could only communicate with your family by writing.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.480
Sometimes it's just easier to speak.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.360
One of the advances of technology is voice recognition.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.000
Whether it's searching the Web:

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.000
<v Tablet user> "Nineteenth Century Architecture."

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.200
Dictating emails:

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.180
<v Older man> "Send email to Jack Harding."

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.120
Or controlling your navigation app.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.740
Many people with physical disabilities 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.940
rely on voice recognition to use the computer.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.380
<v Man in wheelchair> "Place order."

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.120
But for that to happen websites and apps need to be properly coded.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.160
<v Man in wheelchair> "Go? Cancel?"

00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:14.920
Voice recognition could help lots of other people

00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:17.740
with temporary limitations too, like an injured arm.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.740
<v Woman> "Place order."

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.240
It can also prevent injuries becoming worse,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.400
like RSI: Repetitive Stress Injury.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.020
Or for people simply preferring voice.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.600
<v Computer> "Some people can't see the text on this screen."

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.480
<v Computer> "Fortunately, computers can convert text to speech."

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.580
It's technology that many people who are blind have been relying on for years.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.180
But it's also important for many people with dyslexia.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.020
And very useful for people who have difficulty reading text.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.000
As well as some people who just like to multi-task.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.020
But for this to work,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.040
websites and apps have to be properly coded.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.120
Which has the added benefit of helping search engines index websites' contents better.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.700
Poor layout can be very frustrating.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.960
And the same applies to the Web.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.340
Good design involves good layout

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.780
and that means a better user experience.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.920
This includes clear headings, navigation bars, and consistent styling.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.100
Any web user will get frustrated with bad layout and design.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.160
Complex layouts also make finding information difficult

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.620
or impossible for people with visual disabilities.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.660
And they are confusing for people with cognitive and learning disabilities

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.980
who need clarity and consistency of the presentation.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.340
Bad design also impacts anyone who isn't particularly confident around computers.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.600
All the right gears can be put in motion.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.020
The hands can be at the exact place they need to be.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.140
But if you don't get the response that you're expecting,

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.780
you'll end up wondering if there's some sort of problem.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.380
It's the same on the Web.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.900
Without clear notifications and feedback,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.220
people are quickly disorientated and confused.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.620
Especially error messages which are often complex and confusing.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.880
Yet making the understandable is usually quite simple.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.380
Making websites and apps predictable and understandable

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.960
makes them accessible to people with cognitive and learning disabilities,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.760
and more usable for everyone.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.020
Especially for people with lower computer skills.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.900
Trying to hit a small target requires lots of effort.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.980
Many websites and applications try to thread the needle.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.580
But on the Web, we can make areas for clicking and tapping larger and easier to use.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.220
Which is handy on mobile devices

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.680
especially when we might be moving around at the time.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.460
Which is critical for people with reduced dexterity.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.080
What's right for you

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.180
doesn't necessarily work for the next person.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.200
Customization isn't always just a question of preference though.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.060
Sometimes, it's a necessity.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.740
Being able to adjust the text is crucial with low vision and dyslexia.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.620
Properly coded websites and applications allow the text to be customized.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.080
For example, to change its size, spacing, font, and colors

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.620
without loss of functions or clarity.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.840
Instead of saying:

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.120
"To postulate a conceit more irksome

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.680
than being addressed in sesquipedalian syntax is adamantine",

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.200
it is better to say:

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.700
"Being spoken to in unnecessarily long

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.860
and complicated language is a pain".

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.980
Yet many websites lack structuring

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.180
using headings, lists, and separations.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.920
Or they use overly complex language, jargon,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.360
and unexplained acronyms.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.000
It makes them difficult and unappealing for many people,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
including non-native speakers,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.980
and makes them unusable for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.300
Not being able to use your computer

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.260
because you mouse doesn't work, is frustrating.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.720
Many people use only the keyboard to navigate websites.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.140
Either through preference or circumstance.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.340
Whether it's temporarily limited mobility,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.580
a permanent physical disability,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.580
or simply a broken mouse,

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.580
the result is the same:

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.520
Websites and apps need to be operable by keyboard.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.800
Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all.
