Video isn't just about pictures,

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:07.920
it's also about sound.

00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:12.920
Without the audio you would have to guess what this film is about.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.880
Frustrating, isn't it?

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.280
Not knowing what's going on.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.000
That's the situation for everyone who can't hear.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.240
Captions make videos accessible.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.160
Which is also handy for people who want to watch video in loud environments.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.030
Or where you need to be very, very quiet.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.760
Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all.
