00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.840
Instead of saying:

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.120
"To postulate a conceit more irksome

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.680
than being addressed in sesquipedalian syntax is adamantine",

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.200
it is better to say:

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.700
"Being spoken to in unnecessarily long

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.860
and complicated language is a pain".

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.980
Yet many websites lack structuring

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.180
using headings, lists, and separations.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.920
Or they use overly complex language, jargon,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.360
and unexplained acronyms.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.000
It makes them difficult and unappealing for many people,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
including non-native speakers,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.980
and makes them unusable for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.640
Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all.
