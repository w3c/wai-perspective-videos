00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.360
<v Audio Descriptions> A man in a kitchen is looking for thing to make a coffee.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.800
<v Audio Descriptions> The man is frustrated about not finding what he is looking for.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.240
<v Audio Descriptions> The man rearranges the kitchen in a time-lapse.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.920
<v Audio Descriptions> The man is now browsing a badly laid out pizza delivery website and is shaking his head.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.340
<v Audio Descriptions> A woman is using the same complex website with screen magnification.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Audio Descriptions> She only sees a portion of the screen at a time, so the website appears even more confusing.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.640
<v Audio Descriptions> The woman is shaking her head and is unable to use that website.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.600
<v Audio Descriptions> The man calls a friend over to help.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.620
<v Audio Descriptions> The friend is just as confused and navigates to a different, better pizza website.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.200
<v Audio Descriptions> This second website is much clearer and easier to use. They are both happy.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.860
<v Audio Descriptions>The woman using screen magnification has also used that website and is delightfully eating a pizza.
