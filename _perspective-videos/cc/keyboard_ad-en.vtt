00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.420
Not being able to use your computer

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.240
because your mouse doesn't work, is frustrating.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.600
Many people use only the keyboard to navigate websites.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.120
Either through preference or circumstance.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.100
Whether it's temporarily limited mobility,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.840
a permanent physical disability,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.060
or simply a broken mouse,

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.620
the result is the same:

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.740
Websites and apps need to be operable by keyboard.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.700
Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all.
