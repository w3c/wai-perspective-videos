00:00:08.705 --> 00:00:08.715
<v Audio Descriptions> A man in a kitchen is looking for thing to make a coffee.

00:00:15.785 --> 00:00:15.790
<v Audio Descriptions> The man is frustrated about not finding what he is looking for.

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:15.800
<v Audio Descriptions> The man rearranges the kitchen in a time-lapse.

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:21.935
<v Audio Descriptions> The man is now browsing a badly laid out pizza delivery website and is shaking his head.

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:27.110
<v Audio Descriptions> A woman is using the same complex website with screen magnification.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:21.115
<v Audio Descriptions> She only sees a portion of the screen at a time, so the website appears even more confusing.

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:34.635
<v Audio Descriptions> The woman is shaking her head and is unable to use that website.

00:00:41.985 --> 00:00:41.990
<v Audio Descriptions> The man calls a friend over to help.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:41.995
<v Audio Descriptions> The friend is just as confused and navigates to a different, better pizza website.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.380
<v Audio Descriptions> This second website is much clearer and easier to use. They are both happy.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.400
<v Audio Descriptions> The woman using screen magnification has also used that website and is delightfully eating a pizza.
